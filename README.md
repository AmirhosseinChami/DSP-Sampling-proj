# DSP Project: Voice Signal Sampling and Reconstruction

This Digital Signal Processing (DSP) project focuses on the sampling and reconstruction of voice signals, with an additional feature that determines the gender of the speaker in a given voice signal.

## Overview
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how to sample and reconstruct a voice signal or function input using various techniques. The repo contains MATLAB code for both analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) and digital-to-analog conversion (DAC), which are commonly used in DSP applications. In addition, we have implemented an algorithm that analyzes the spectral content of a given voice signal to determine whether it belongs to a male or female speaker.
