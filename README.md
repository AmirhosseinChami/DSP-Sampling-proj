# DSP Project: Sampling and Reconstruction of Voice Signals

This is a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) project that focuses on the sampling and reconstruction of voice signals. The project includes an additional feature that determines the gender of the speaker in the voice signal.

## Overview
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how to sample and reconstruct a voice signal or function input using different techniques such as uniform quantization, non-uniform quantization, oversampling, and interpolation. In addition, we have implemented an algorithm that analyzes the spectral content of a given voice signal to determine whether it belongs to a male or female speaker.
